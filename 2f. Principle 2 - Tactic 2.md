## Principle 2: Give the model time to “think”

### Tactic 2: Instruct the model to work out its own solution before rushing to a conclusion

#### Overview:
Instruct the model to **work out** its own solution: By explicitly instructing the model to reason and solve the problem independently before comparing its solution to the provided input, more accurate responses can be obtained. This tactic mimics the way humans approach complex tasks, allowing the model to arrive at a more considered answer.

#### Example 1: Ask direct solution [Incorrect answer]
```python
prompt = f"""
Determine if the student's solution is correct or not.

Question:
I'm building a solar power installation and I need help working out the financials. 
- Land costs $100 / square foot
- I can buy solar panels for $250 / square foot
- I negotiated a contract for maintenance that will cost me a flat $100k per year, and an additional $10 / square foot
What is the total cost for the first year of operations as a function of the number of square feet.

Student's Solution:
Let x be the size of the installation in square feet.
Costs:
1. Land cost: 100x
2. Solar panel cost: 250x
3. Maintenance cost: 100,000 + 100x
Total cost: 100x + 250x + 100,000 + 100x = 450x + 100,000

#### Example 2: Ask the model to work its own solution first [Correct Answer]
```python
prompt = f"""
Your task is to determine if the student's solution is correct or not.
To solve the problem do the following:
- First, work out your own solution to the problem. 
- Then compare your solution to the student's solution and evaluate if the student's solution is correct or not. 
Don't decide if the student's solution is correct until 
you have done the problem yourself.

Use the following format:
Question:
    ```
    question here
    ```
    Student's solution:
    ```
    student's solution here
    ```
    Actual solution:
    ```
    steps to work out the solution and your solution here
    ```
    Is the student's solution the same as actual solution \
    just calculated:
    ```
    yes or no
    ```
    Student grade:
    ```
    correct or incorrect
    ```
