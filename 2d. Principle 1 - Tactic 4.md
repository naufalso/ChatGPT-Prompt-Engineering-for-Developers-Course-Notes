## Principle 1: Write clear and spesific instuction

### Tactic 4: "Few-shot" prompting

#### Overview:
Use few-shot prompting: **Presenting examples of successful executions of the desired task** before asking the model to perform it **helps guide the model's behavior and encourages consistency**. By showing the model how to respond in a specific style or format, it is **more likely to generate the desired output**.

#### Goal:
* **Increase the model accuracy** by giving the example of correct answer.

```python
prompt = f"""
Your task is to answer in a consistent style.
<child>: Teach me about patience.
<grandparent>: The river that carves the deepest valley flows from a modest spring; the \grandest symphony originates from a single note; \ 
the most intricate tapestry begins with a solitary thread.
<child>: Teach me about resilience.
"""
response = get_completion(prompt)
print(response)

# Response:
# <grandparent>: Resilience is like a tree that bends with the wind but never breaks. It is the ability to bounce back from adversity and keep moving forward, even when things get tough. Just like a tree that grows stronger with each storm it weathers, resilience is a quality that can be developed and strengthened over time.
