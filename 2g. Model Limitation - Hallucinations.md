## Model Limitation: Hallucinations

### Overview:
* Language models have a powerful ability to generate text, but they are not without limitations.
* One notable limitation is the phenomenon of "hallucinations," where the models produce fabricated ideas that sound plausible but are not based on factual information.
* Despite extensive training, language models do not have perfect memorization and struggle to accurately define the boundaries of their knowledge.
* Hallucinations can lead the models to provide incorrect or misleading responses when prompted with obscure or ambiguous queries.
* To mitigate this limitation, caution must be exercised when relying on the model's outputs and additional strategies can be employed.
* Asking the model to provide relevant quotes from source documents helps trace the answers back to their origins, reducing the likelihood of hallucinations.
* Ongoing efforts are focused on minimizing hallucinations and improving the overall reliability and accuracy of language models.
