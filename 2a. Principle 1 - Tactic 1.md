## Principle 1: Write clear and spesific instuction

### Tactic 1: Use delimiters to clearly indicate distinct parts of the inputs

#### Overview:
**Use delimiters**: Delimiters such as triple backticks or other clear punctuation can separate specific parts of the input, indicating to the model what should be focused on. Delimiters also help prevent prompt injections, where user instructions conflict with the intended task.

#### Example: 
* Triple backticks: ```, 
* Triple quotes: """, 
* Triple Dash: ---
* Angle brackets: < >
* XML tag: <tag> </tag>
* Double colon :

#### Goal:

* Help the model to **distinct** the part of instructions and inputs.

```python
text = f"""
You should express what you want a model to do by providing instructions that are as clear and specific as you can possibly make them. This will guide the model towards the desired output, and reduce the chances of receiving irrelevant or incorrect responses. Don't confuse writing a clear prompt with writing a short prompt. In many cases, longer prompts provide more clarity and context for the model, which can lead to more detailed and relevant outputs.
"""

prompt = f"""
Summarize the text delimited by triple backticks \ 
into a single sentence.
```{text}```
"""

response = get_completion(prompt)
print(response)

# Response:
# Clear and specific instructions should be provided to guide a model towards the desired output, and longer prompts can provide more clarity and context for the model, leading to more detailed and relevant outputs.
```

* Avoid the **prompt injection**

prompt_injected_text = f"""
