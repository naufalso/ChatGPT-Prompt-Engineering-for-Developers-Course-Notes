# 2. Guidelines for Prompting

## Principle 1: Write clear and spesific instuction
The first principle, "Write clear and specific instructions," emphasizes the importance of providing explicit guidance to the language model to obtain desired results. Clear prompts help guide the model towards the desired output and reduce the chances of irrelevant or incorrect responses.

> Note: Clear ≠ Short

### Several tactics are suggested to achieve this clarity:
- Tactic 1: Use delimiters to clearly indicate distinct parts of the input
- Tactic 2: Ask for a structured output.
- Tactic 3: Ask the model to check whether conditions are satisfied
- Tactic 4: "Few-shot" prompting

## Principle 2: Give the model time to “think”
The second principle, "Give the model time to think," highlights the importance of allowing the language model to reason and process information adequately before providing a final answer. Rushing the model to reach a conclusion quickly may result in reasoning errors or incorrect responses. To address this, the following tactics are recommended:

### To address this, the following tactics are recommended:
- Tactic 1: Specify the steps required to complete a task
- Tactic 2: Instruct the model to work out its own solution before rushing to a conclusion
