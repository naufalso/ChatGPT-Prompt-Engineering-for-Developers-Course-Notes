## Principle 1: Write clear and spesific instuction

### Tactic 3: Ask the model to check whether conditions are satisfied

#### Overview:
**Check conditions and handle edge cases:** Instructing the model to check whether specific conditions are satisfied or considering potential edge cases helps ensure accurate and reliable responses. By providing instructions to handle different scenarios, the model can avoid unexpected errors or results.

#### Goal:
* Ensure that the **model checks specified conditions** before proceeding with the task, **reducing the chances of incorrect** or **irrelevant responses**.

#### Example:
- Condition satisfied

Making a cup of tea is easy! First, you need to get some \ 
water boiling. While that's happening, \ 
grab a cup and put a tea bag in it. Once the water is \ 
hot enough, just pour it over the tea bag. \ 
Let it sit for a bit so the tea can steep. After a \ 
few minutes, take out the tea bag. If you \ 
like, you can add some sugar or milk to taste. \ 
And that's it! You've got yourself a delicious \ 
cup of tea to enjoy.

The sun is shining brightly today, and the birds are \
singing. It's a beautiful day to go for a \ 
walk in the park. The flowers are blooming, and the \
