## Principle 1: Write clear and spesific instuction

### Tactic 2: Ask for a structured output

#### Overview:
**Ask for structured output**: Requesting structured output, such as in JSON or HTML format, can make it easier to parse and work with the model's responses. By defining the output format, it becomes more predictable and manageable.

#### Example:
- JSON
- HTML

#### Goal:
* It can help us to use and easily parse the output for our application directly.

```python
prompt = f"""
Generate a list of three made-up book titles along with their authors and genres. 
Provide them in JSON format with the following keys: 
book_id, title, author, genre.
"""
response = get_completion(prompt)
print(response)

# Response:
# [
#   {
#     "book_id": 1,
#     "title": "The Lost City of Zorath",
#     "author": "Aria Blackwood",
#     "genre": "Fantasy"
#   },
#   {
#     "book_id": 2,
#     "title": "The Last Survivors",
#     "author": "Ethan Stone",
#     "genre": "Science Fiction"
#   },
#   {
#     "book_id": 3,
#     "title": "The Secret of the Haunted Mansion",
#     "author": "Lila Rose",
